# Semantic-Segmentation-of-skin-lesson-using-unet
Melanoma detection requires dermoscopy images segmentation, which is one of the medical image segmentation domains. Melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, can strike without warning on healthy skin or grow from a pre-existing lesion. To effectively find lesion locations in histopathologic imaging, skin lesion border segmentation is required. True, accurate skin lesion segmentation remains difficult due to issues such as blurring boundaries, necessitating an accurate and automated skin lesion segmentation approach. Semantic segmentation using deep learning architecture could a helpful and effective tools for this task. Here, I have tried to segment skin lesson using u-net based deep learning model and found good results.
To run this project, download the dataset(given the link) and upload the images to the driveif you are using google colab.  Then upload the .IPYBN file to the colab and reset the folder path according to yours.
